          <h3>Dissertation</h3>
          <p>
            The topic of my dissertation focused around a self-defined project entitled:
            <strong>
              "Construction of
              Automotive Control Software"
            </strong>, I produced an Anti-Lock Braking System (ABS) which
            attempted to mimic the timing characteristics of commercial ABS products, by implementing an older algorithm
            as defined in a paper published by <strong>Bosch</strong>. However, this paper did not completely describe the
            system's construction (particularly determining vehicle speed within the ABS Electronic Control Unit)
            and so work from several other research areas were combined to produce a working Anti-lock Braking
            System that reflects those used in the real world.
          </p>
          <LightBoxComponent />
          <p>
            The majority of this work was completed using
            <strong>C/C++</strong>. An open-source driving simulator
            <a href="http://www.speed-dreams.org/">Speed Dreams 2</a>, featuring realistic
            tire physics and individual wheel braking, was used in verifying code functionality. <a href="ABSConstruction.pdf">View a copy of my dissertation here!</a>

          <h2>Volunteering</h2>
          <p>
          Participating with effective volunteering organizations in the past has been greatly rewarding and
          provided me with a number of valuable skills and attitudes. I hope to continue working in such positions in the future.
          </p>
          <h3>Archelon</h3>
          <p>
            In the summer after my first year at University, I spent 2 months in Greece volunteering with the
            <a
              href="https://www.archelon.gr/index_eng.php"
            >Sea Turtle Protection Society of Greece (Archelon)</a>. Where I helped in tracking loggerhead sea turtles and their nests,
            morning/night monitoring of protected nesting beaches, and fundraising for the charity by operating a
            small kiosk, which dispensed information and souviners to tourists. Throughout this time, I had cooking and
            cleaning responsibilities for a group of 50 volunteers.
          </p>
          <p>
            I found this a really fun and rewarding experience, which fostered the growth of a number of valuable skills.
            For instance, the large team in which I worked was composed of mixed nationalities and language barriers were
            often present in day to day life, which greatly progressed my communication and teamwork skills.
          </p>
          <h3>Raleigh International</h3>
          <p>
            After graduating from University, I spent 3 months in rural Tanzania working alongside both UK and Tanzanian volunteers
            to provide daily entrepreneurial classes to villagers, with <a href="https://raleighinternational.org/">Raleigh International</a>. This work intended to
            arm such poverty stricken areas with the Knowledge necessary to start sustainable businesses, and provided several grants
            to locals to help fund their businesses.
          </p>
          <p>
            Throughout this time, all 20 volunteers in our team lived among local families, eating local foods and becoming ecnompassed within the community.
            As well as organize lessons we also coordinated several events to raise awareness of our work, each of which attracted over 200 people.
